        <p> I currently run a small business that assists small telecommunication firms in strategically optimizing their B2B billing practices.  I also provide other various business services such as forecasting, database management, financial/data analysis, rate research, and audit services. </p>
        
        <p> JIn the past few years, there has been vast consolidation within the telecom industry and regulatory laws have begun to favor big telecoms.  This has made it difficult to obtain new business and also have squeezed margins for my largest existing client and thus for my business. </p> 
        
        <p> Rather than scramble within the telecom realm any longer, I have decided to go in a new direction professionally.  I want to work in a more progressive industry that isn't so highly regulated and where there are cool developments every day.  I have vast experience with business analytics and financial analysis, and believe that my skills are transferrable to virtually any industry.  I want to be surrounded by curious and smart people in an environment that supports continuous improvement of both business and employees.  My focus right now is on young, high-growth organizations in Chicago.  Cuture is very important to me, and I believe that a startup atmosphere will best merge with my entreprenurial spirit and cross-functional experience.  I look forward to this journey and am excited to start the next chapter in my professional life </p>
